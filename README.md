# Project 2.0

### [TASK 1: SMART RING](https://github.com/GayatriRR/Minitask3/blob/master/Task1:%20Smart%20Ring.md)
The idea behind this ring is to make the ring light up when worn by the user. The previous model involved a switch which would get pressed when worn that would light up the LED. Thus, it gives rise to the idea of lighting it up using touch sensors.


### [TASK 2: HEXAPOD](https://github.com/GayatriRR/Minitask3/blob/master/Task2:%20%20Hexapod.md)
A Hexapod is a spider-like robot whose motion is based on a spider's. The task is to mirror the Hexapod's actions on a computer using sensors on the pod to sense its motion.

### [TASK 3: MICROMOUSE MAZE](https://github.com/GayatriRR/Minitask3/blob/master/Task3:%20%20Micromouse%20Maze.md)
A micromouse is a pre-programmed mini-robot that can solve the maze on its own, without intervention from the owner. It is usually played as a competition between different such micromice to see the one which would solve the maze first.
