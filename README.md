## [TASK 1: SMART RING](https://github.com/GayatriRR/Minitask3/blob/master/Task1:%20Smart%20Ring.md)
The idea behind this ring is to make the ring light up when worn by the user. The previous model involved a switch which would get pressed when worn that would light up the LED. Thus, it gives rise to the idea of lighting it up using touch sensors.
