## CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR REINFORCED LEARNING FOR A HEXAPOD

The Hexapod has 6 legs which has 3 degrees of freedom. We need to take information of the movement of the of each leg and reflect the exact same on the computer using reinforced learning.

* For this, there are servo motors which help in the movement of the hexapod. The movement of the hexapod is sensed by IMU sensors, 3 on each leg. A total of 19 IMU sensors must to be send information to the microcontroller. 
* The IMU sensor can give a
